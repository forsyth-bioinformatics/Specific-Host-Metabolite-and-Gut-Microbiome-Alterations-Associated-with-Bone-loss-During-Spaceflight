This folder contains R scripts and the generated result and plot files. The files are arranged by two sample types: oral and fecal.
R scripts used for creating final figurs in the revised manuscript were in the folders fecal_no_rarefaction and oral_no_rarefaction for the fecal and oral samples respectively.
